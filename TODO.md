# elivagar TODO

## Release prep

- [ ] Publish `pbfhogg` to crates.io first (currently a path dependency)
- [ ] Switch `pbfhogg` dependency from path to crates.io version
- [ ] Publish `elivagar` to crates.io

## GitHub

- [ ] Write GitHub repo description and tags (vector-tiles, openstreetmap, pmtiles, shortbread, rust)
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions CI — clippy, tests, `cargo build --release` on Linux
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions release pipeline — build binaries on tag push, attach to GitHub release
- [ ] Add a CHANGELOG.md before first tagged release

## Website

- [ ] Write a small 1-page project website (what it does, benchmark, usage, link to repo)
- [ ] Host via GitHub Pages

## Bugs

- [ ] **[P2]** `area_sq_meters` cos²(lat) approximation — moderate risk for high-latitude
  regions near area thresholds. See `geometry.rs` docstring for details and fix options.

## Quality

- [ ] Visual verification — tracked in nidhogg TODO
- [ ] Planet-scale test — run on full planet PBF (~73 GB), needs NVMe server

---

- [ ] Generally check for updates to all dependencies.

## Profiling

Hotpath profile results and analysis: `docs/hotpath-profile.md`

## Performance

Investigated-and-rejected optimizations are documented in code comments at each site.

- [ ] **Visvalingam-Whyatt instead of Douglas-Peucker.** VW computes per-vertex importance
  once in O(n log n), then each zoom level filters by threshold — no re-scanning. Would
  replace DP entirely. Requires new algorithm, tolerance recalibration, and visual verification.

- [ ] **Compression level tradeoff [pre-release]** — Level 6 is used; level 3-4 would be
  noticeably faster with ~5% larger output. Make configurable. Final tuning item — do this
  right before 0.1 release after all other optimizations are locked in. (`pipeline.rs:1239`)

- [ ] **Rayon alternatives for slice-based parallelism** — Research notes in previous git
  history. Key options: paralight, orx-parallel, chili, forte. Not a current bottleneck.

- [ ] **NodeIndex madvise for planet scale** — `NodeIndexReader::advise_random()` exists but
  is not called. May help at planet scale where locality breaks down across continents.
  Full investigation: `docs/madvise-investigation.md`.

## Test Coverage Gaps

- [ ] **No integration test for PMTiles output validity** — No test verifies generated PMTiles can be read back and tiles decoded correctly (beyond header check).
